## Description

[View Project](https://mayamariaruth.github.io/html-css-course-assignment/index.html)

This project is an interactive e-commerce website designed to sell men's and womenâ€™s rain jackets suitable for a variety of outdoor activities. The primary goal is to provide a user-friendly online shopping experience where customers can browse, and purchase durable, weather-resistant jackets that are perfect for hiking, skiing, camping, canoeing, and other outdoor adventures.

The website is built using JavaScript to dynamically display products retrieved from an API, allowing users to view detailed product pages, add items to their cart, and proceed to checkout. The project features a responsive design with a seamless shopping experience, complete with loading indicators and error handling for a smooth user journey.
